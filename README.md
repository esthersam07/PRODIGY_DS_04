# PRODIGY_DS_04
This project analyzes social media sentiment to understand public opinions and attitudes toward specific topics or brands. By leveraging the VADER Sentiment Analysis tool, the project processes a dataset of tweets, cleans the text, and classifies the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. Visualizations are created to highlight sentiment distribution and trends. Optional techniques like topic modeling are also incorporated to gain insights into specific areas of discussion. The project aims to provide actionable insights from social media data to improve brand awareness and consumer sentiment analysis
